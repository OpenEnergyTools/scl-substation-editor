## What is this?

This is an editor plugin for [open-scd-core](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd-core#readme), the new core editor engine for OpenSCD.

This plugins allows you to edit, remove and add all elements within the `Substation` section including the elements `Line` and `Process` which can be technically parents/siblings of Substation.

## What is on the roadmap

- Add copy feature for `VoltageLevel` and `Bay` elements.
- Something missing: file an [issue](https://github.com/openenergytools/scl-substation-editor/issues) and we do our best to add it.

## Online access on [OpEnToSCL](https://openenergytools.github.io/scl-editor)

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

```bash
npm start
```

To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`
